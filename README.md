Monitoring environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity is essential in various fields, from agriculture and healthcare to home automation and weather forecasting. This project focuses on designing a simple yet effective temperature and humidity monitoring system using an Arduino microcontroller and a DHT sensor (such as DHT11 or DHT22).

The DHT sensor is a low-cost digital sensor capable of providing accurate readings of ambient temperature and relative humidity. When connected to an Arduino, it allows real-time data acquisition and display, making it ideal for educational purposes, DIY electronics, and practical applications like greenhouse monitoring or climate control systems.

In this project, the sensor collects data from the surrounding environment, which the Arduino processes and displays on a serial monitor or an LCD screen. This hands-on implementation not only demonstrates the practical use of sensors and microcontrollers but also introduces basic concepts in embedded systems, data acquisition, and environmental monitoring.
